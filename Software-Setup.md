Below are links to installing and setting up the software we will commonly use (whether you are on a PC or a Mac), along with links to useful software manuals:


### Software installs
#### GitHub
We use GitHub for task management and software version control. Send your GitHub username to the group member in charge of setting up the GitHub repository, so that you can be added.
If you have not used GitHub before, [join GitHub](https://github.com/join) and also either [install GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Resources for learning git and GitHub workflow:
- [GitHub cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
- [10-minute GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [GitHub learning resources](https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/)
- [Mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)


#### Slack
We use [Slack](https://slack.com/) for: (1) brief communications and questions that can be easily resolved without creating a formal GitHub issue; and (2) recording meeting notes. Download desktop and mobile [apps](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users#3.-download-our-desktop-and-mobile-apps) for Slack.

#### Latex
We write papers in latex. You will need a latex compiler from [MikTex](https://miktex.org/) as well as a text editor that integrates with MikTex. [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) and [WinEdt](http://www.winedt.com/) are two options, among others, you might consider.

#### Python
Python is a flexible object oriented programming language with many uses.

- [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/)


#### Stata
When possible, data analysis will be done in [Stata](http://www.stata.com/). A university license may be available, or you can [order Stata directly](http://www.stata.com/order/).

- [A Little Bit of Stata Programming Goes a Long Way](http://www.stata.com/meeting/11uk/baum.pdf)
- An Introduction to Modern Econometrics Using Stata, hard copy

#### Matlab
Simulation and estimation routines that exceed Stata's capabilities will often be done in [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). A university license may be available, or you can [order Matlab directly](https://www.mathworks.com/pricing-licensing.html?prodcode=ML).
- [Getting started](https://www.mathworks.com/help/pdf_doc/matlab/getstart.pdf)
- [Matlab for economists](https://ideas.repec.org/p/tcd/tcduee/tep0414.html)

#### R
In some situations, data analysis will be done in R.
[Download R](https://cran.rstudio.com/).  
You may wish to use [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to edit R code.
