We generally should follow the [Gentzkow and Shapiro Stata style guide](https://github.com/gslab-econ/ra-manual/wiki/Stata), with the following exceptions:
* We do not use their `save_data` or `mmerge` commands.
* Please always use `saveold` instead of `save`, as different users may have different versions of Stata.
